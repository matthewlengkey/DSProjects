A big make up company called X has just launched their latest blush on products. 
The company has a marketing plan in order to increase their sales on their new product in the U.S. especially for young people. 
The company wants to conduct their marketing campaigns through the social media, 
specifically YouTube since YouTube has a huge market for the company to do their marketing campaign. 
I gave recommendation through data analysis and visualization.
